### Midterm Concept:

#### Andrew Cotter

For my Midterm, I'd like to keep pushing my understanding of firmata, and use the Arduino's analog inputs to control flocking behaviors and synthesized sounds runnning in openFrameworks. In this way, someone interacting with the Arduino will produce sythesized sounds and influence the flocking behavior.

Critical Concepts & Implementations:

- Flocking Behavior ( vis a vis Craig Reynolds )
- Firmata communication ( ofArduino )
- Waveforms and Sound Synthesis
